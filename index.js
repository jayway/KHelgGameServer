// WebSocket connections:

/*
 * Strategy for connections:
 *
 * Keep track of all open sockets.
 * When a user registers (with 'add player')
 * then add to players list, and tag the socket
 * with the playername
 * 
 * Check if players list contain at least two players
 * If so start a new game with them if there isn't an
 * ongoing game. Remaining players are spectators.
 *
 * When game is over the players that just played
 * will have to re-register in order to join the game
 * queue. The next two people in line will start playing.
 * 
 * When a player disconnects remove the player from player
 * list if the player name exists there.
 * If an undefined player disconnects (a user that hasn't registered)
 * nothing happens.
 * If the disconnecting player is currently playing a game,
 * the game stops.
 *
 * If a move command arrives, check that the sender 
 * is actually playing a game. If so, move, otherwise do nothing.
 
 * When a player has won, the game is stopped.
 *
 * Messages are broadcasted out to everyone if the sender
 * is registered.
